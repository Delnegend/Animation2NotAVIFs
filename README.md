  - [Rav1e](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/releases) (fallback transcoding) (already included)

- How to use
  - Create a folder name `input` and put your GIF(s) or whatever it is into, as long as it moves (and ffmpeg can decode)
  - Run `python run-me.py`
  - Output file(s) will be in `output` folder

- Notes:
  - Height is limited to 1080px because having a high resolution is possible, but not practice.
